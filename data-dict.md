## StateTerritory

This table stores a hard-coded list of the states and territories within Australia. It is used as a basis for sorting individual suburbs that are serviced by Workforce Link. Both the name and abbreviation is stored so that it can be used to write full location names. (eg. Fortitude Valley, Queensland, 4006)

## Postcode

This table stores a list of postal codes within Australia that correspond to areas serviced by Workforce Link. It is used to match postcodes to suburbs, and write full location names. (eg. Milton, Queensland, 4064). See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_Australia) for more information on how postcodes work.

## Location

This table stores a list of suburbs and towns that are serviced by Workforce Link. When filling out their profile, a support worker can select a known suburb as their home location. The latitude and longitude indicates an 'origin point' which is used to help measure distances between suburbs when searching for support workers. (eg. Within 20 kilometres of Yamanto)

## CulturalBackground

This table stores a hard-coded list of cultural backgrounds that support workers can select as being a part of. This is not necessarily the same thing as spoken language. It simply indicates what culture they identify with.

Since cultural background is subjective, this version of the database only includes generic, geographical-based cultures such as 'West European'. There are also distinct list items for Indigenous Australian cultures. An 'Other' option has been included in case the user identifies as a culture not covered by the list.

## FearPhobia

This table stores a hard-coded list of fears and phobias that support workers can select to display on their profile. This version of the database contains the top 20 most common phobias as listed by [FearOf.net](https://www.fearof.net/).
